# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Introduction

My name is Matthew Weisman, and welcome to my data analytics porfolio!

Within this portfolio, you will find links to my completed data analysis projects, each showcasing a range of analytical skills. From data cleaning/validation and database development to EDA and data visualization, these projects encompass a wide array of data-related tasks.

To complete these projects, I used a variety of tools and software. For database work, I utilized SQL to create and analyze databases, as well as to generate reports. Additionally, I used Python to complete tasks involving data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I also leveraged Power BI to craft interactive dashboards.

In the [projects section](#projects), you'll find summaries of each project, along with links to their respective repositories for further exploration.

## About Me

As a data analyst, I have a strong passion for working with data. During my college years, I first discovered my interest in data analysis through internships in corporate and public accounting. Much of the work I performed during these positions involved financial data analysis, which led me to realize my genuine enjoyment in hands-on using data to find and extract insight. This discovery sparked my curiosity to explore the field of analytics further and enhance my data analysis skills.

Through a combination of formal education, work experience, and online learning, I have gained knowledge in tools such as SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel.

## Projects

### 1. [Personal Finance Database and Dashboard](https://github.com/weismanm12/finances-database)

In this project, I developed a MySQL database to keep track of all my financial data and enable analysis, along with a Power BI dashboard to visualize spending trends. I extracted all transactions from my bank website and developed custom Python scripts to automate the bulk of the ETL process, allowing for easy maintenance of the database. SQL views were also created to act as reports, tracking KPI's such as monthly spending, spending by category, and changes in account balances. Additionally, the dashboard was linked directly to the MySQL database, providing valuable up to-date-insights in a visual manner. Note that the data in this project has been falsified to preserve privacy.

### 2. [Analyzing Movie Data From IMDb](https://github.com/weismanm12/movies-analysis)
This project involved processing and analyzing movie data from the popular online movie database, IMDb. I extracted [public IMDb datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/), cleaned and transformed this data via Python, and stored the data in a PostgreSQL database I created. I then performed analysis using a combination of SQL queries and Python code to find trends in movie production, audience reception, and actor likeness.

### 3. [Sales Analysis and Marketing KPI Tracking for an Online Retailer](https://github.com/weismanm12/retailer-eda-and-marketing-kpis)

In this project, I analyzed two years of sales data from a fictional UK-based online retailer. I performed exploratory analysis to exam sales trends, such as sales by category, country, sales over time. I then wrote a Python script to streamline the generation of a marketing metrics report, calculating various different marketing metrics per quarter and evaluating the success of marketing operations.
